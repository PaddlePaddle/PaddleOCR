# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create an pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - "All docstrings and comments should be up to date."
  - "There should be no trailing whitespace at the end of lines."
  - "Indentation should be consistent throughout the codebase."
  - "Variable and function names should be descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention."
  - "There should be no commented out code in the codebase."
  - "There should be no unused imports in the codebase."
