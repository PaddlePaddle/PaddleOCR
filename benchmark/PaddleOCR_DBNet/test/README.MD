Place the images that you want to detect here. You better named them as such:
img_10.jpg
img_11.jpg
img_{img_id}.jpg

For predicting single images, you can change the `img_path` in the `/tools/predict.py` to your image number.

The result will be saved in the output_folder(default is test/output) you give in predict.sh
