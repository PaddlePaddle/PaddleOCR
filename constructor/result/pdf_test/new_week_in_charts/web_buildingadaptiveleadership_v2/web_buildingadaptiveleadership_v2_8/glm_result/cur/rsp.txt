"这是一页来自麦肯锡公司（McKinsey & Company）的文章页面，标题为“Today's business leaders and organizations face a similar dynamic—this time confronting not one but a range of technical, economic, geopolitical, and social disruptions. To avoid a fate like that of their historical factory-owner counterparts, leaders must acknowledge two critical factors associated with change—resilience and adaptability—and the codependent relationship between them. They must build workplace conditions that allow individuals and teams to become more resilient and adaptable, and they must integrate these skills with their business strategies. Leaders—and, frankly, the world—can't afford to take another three decades to figure out how to integrate and adapt when the next big game changer in business emerges.”\n\n文章的作者是Jacqueline Brassey、Aaron De Smet和Sheila Rabipour。Jacqueline Brassey是麦肯锡健康工作组的联合负责人，研究科学主任，位于新泽西州办公室；Aaron De Smet是麦肯锡的资深合伙人，位于英国、爱尔兰和以色列办公室；Sheila Rabipour是蒙特利尔办公室的顾问。\n\n文章感谢了Alistair Carmichael、Anastasia Perez Terment、Anna Roth、Barbara Jeffery、Cara Volpe、Johanne Lavoie、Laura Pineault、Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi、Nicolette Rainone、Roxy Merklan、Sophie Merckelbach和Yueyang Chen对本文的贡献。\n\n文章的版权属于2024年的麦肯锡公司，所有权利保留。"
