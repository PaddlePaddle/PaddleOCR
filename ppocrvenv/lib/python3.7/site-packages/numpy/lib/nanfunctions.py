    Notes
    -----
    NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic

    Positive infinity is treated as a very large number and negative
    infinity is treated as a very small (i.e. negative) number.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose product is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the product is computed. The default is to compute
        the product of the flattened array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  By default, the dtype of `a` is used.  An
        exception is when `a` has an integer type with less precision than
        the platform (u)intp. In that case, the default will be either
        (u)int32 or (u)int64 depending on whether the platform is 32 or 64
        bits. For inexact inputs, dtype must be inexact.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``. If provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary. See
        :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details. The casting of NaN to integer
        can yield unexpected results.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as
        dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will
        broadcast correctly against the original `arr`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose mean is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the means are computed. The default is to compute

        is `float64`; for inexact inputs, it is the same as the input
        dtype.
    out : ndarray, optional

        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

        If the value is anything but the default, then

        of sub-classes of `ndarray`.  If the sub-classes methods
        does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    m : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out=None`, returns a new array containing the mean values,
        otherwise a reference to the output array is returned. Nan is
        returned for slices that contain only NaNs.

    --------
    average : Weighted average

    Notes
    -----
    The arithmetic mean is the sum of the non-NaN elements along the axis
    divided by the number of non-NaN elements.

    Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32`.  Specifying a
    higher-precision accumulator using the `dtype` keyword can alleviate
    this issue.

    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : {int, sequence of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the medians are computed. The default
        is to compute the median along a flattened version of the array.
        A sequence of axes is supported since version 1.9.0.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
       If True, then allow use of memory of input array `a` for
       calculations. The input array will be modified by the call to
       `median`. This will save memory when you do not need to preserve
       the contents of the input array. Treat the input as undefined,
       but it will probably be fully or partially sorted. Default is
       False. If `overwrite_input` is ``True`` and `a` is not already an
       `ndarray`, an error will be raised.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

        a sub-class and `mean` does not have the kwarg `keepdims` this
        will raise a RuntimeError.

    Returns
    -------
    median : ndarray
        A new array holding the result. If the input contains integers
        or floats smaller than ``float64``, then the output data-type is
        ``np.float64``.  Otherwise, the data-type of the output is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the median of ``V`` is the
    middle value of a sorted copy of ``V``, ``V_sorted`` - i.e.,
    ``V_sorted[(N-1)/2]``, when ``N`` is odd and the average of the two

        Percentile or sequence of percentiles to compute, which must be between

    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional

    out : ndarray, optional

        `a` after this function completes is undefined.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to
        use when the desired percentile lies between two data points
        ``i < j``:

        * 'linear': ``i + (j - i) * fraction``, where ``fraction``
          is the fractional part of the index surrounded by ``i``
          and ``j``.
        * 'lower': ``i``.
        * 'higher': ``j``.
        * 'nearest': ``i`` or ``j``, whichever is nearest.
        * 'midpoint': ``(i + j) / 2``.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
        the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
        result will broadcast correctly against the original array `a`.

        If this is anything but the default value it will be passed
        through (in the special case of an empty array) to the
        `mean` function of the underlying array.  If the array is
        a sub-class and `mean` does not have the kwarg `keepdims` this
        will raise a RuntimeError.

    Returns
    -------
    percentile : scalar or ndarray
        If `q` is a single percentile and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple percentiles are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the percentiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
        data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the ``q``-th percentile of
    ``V`` is the value ``q/100`` of the way from the minimum to the
    maximum in a sorted copy of ``V``. The values and distances of
    the two nearest neighbors as well as the `interpolation` parameter
    will determine the percentile if the normalized ranking does not
    match the location of ``q`` exactly. This function is the same as
    the median if ``q=50``, the same as the minimum if ``q=0`` and the
    same as the maximum if ``q=100``.

    .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array, containing
        nan values to be ignored
    q : array_like of float
        Quantile or sequence of quantiles to compute, which must be between
        0 and 1 inclusive.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the quantiles are computed. The
        default is to compute the quantile(s) along a flattened
        version of the array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
        If True, then allow the input array `a` to be modified by intermediate
        calculations, to save memory. In this case, the contents of the input
        `a` after this function completes is undefined.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to
        use when the desired quantile lies between two data points
        ``i < j``:

        * linear: ``i + (j - i) * fraction``, where ``fraction``
          is the fractional part of the index surrounded by ``i``
          and ``j``.
        * lower: ``i``.
        * higher: ``j``.
        * nearest: ``i`` or ``j``, whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: ``(i + j) / 2``.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
        the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
        result will broadcast correctly against the original array `a`.

        If this is anything but the default value it will be passed
        through (in the special case of an empty array) to the
        `mean` function of the underlying array.  If the array is
        a sub-class and `mean` does not have the kwarg `keepdims` this
        will raise a RuntimeError.

    Returns
    -------
    quantile : scalar or ndarray
        If `q` is a single percentile and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple quantiles are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the quantiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
        data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    --------

    nanmean, nanmedian
    nanmedian : equivalent to ``nanquantile(..., 0.5)``

    Returns
    -------
    variance : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the variance,
        otherwise return a reference to the output array. If ddof is >= the
        number of non-NaN elements in a slice or the slice contains only
        NaNs, then the result for that slice is NaN.

    mean : Average
    var : Variance while not ignoring NaNs
    nanstd, nanmean
    :ref:`ufuncs-output-type`

    Notes
    -----
    The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean,
    i.e.,  ``var = mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2)``.

    The mean is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.
    If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used
    instead.  In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an
    unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite
    population.  ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the
    variance for normally distributed variables.

    Note that for complex numbers, the absolute value is taken before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the variance is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the ``dtype``
    keyword can alleviate this issue.

    For this function to work on sub-classes of ndarray, they must define
    `sum` with the kwarg `keepdims`

    -------
    standard_deviation : ndarray, see dtype parameter above.
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the standard
        deviation, otherwise return a reference to the output array. If

    :ref:`ufuncs-output-type`

    Notes
    -----
    The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared
    deviations from the mean: ``std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))``.

    The average squared deviation is normally calculated as
    ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.  If, however, `ddof` is
    specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used instead. In standard
    statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an unbiased estimator of the
    variance of the infinite population. ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum
    likelihood estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables.
    The standard deviation computed in this function is the square root of
    the estimated variance, so even with ``ddof=1``, it will not be an
    unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se.

    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute value before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the *std* is computed using the same
    precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32 (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the `dtype`
    keyword can alleviate this issue.
