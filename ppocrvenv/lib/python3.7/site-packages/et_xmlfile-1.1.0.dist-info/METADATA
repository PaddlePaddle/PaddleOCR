et_xmfile
=========

et_xmlfile is a low memory library for creating large XML files.

It is based upon the `xmlfile module from lxml <http://lxml.de/api.html#incremental-xml-generation>`_ with the aim of allowing code to be developed that will work with both libraries. It was developed initially for the openpyxl project but is now a standalone module.

The code was written by Elias Rabel as part of the `Python DÃ¼sseldorf <http://pyddf.de>`_ openpyxl sprint in September 2014.


Note on performance
-------------------

The code was not developed with performance in mind but turned out to be faster than the existing SAX-based implementation but is significantly slower than lxml's xmlfile. There is one area where an optimisation for lxml will negatively affect the performance of et_xmfile and that is when using the `.element()` method on an xmlfile context manager. It is, therefore, recommended not to use this, though the method is provided for code compatibility.
