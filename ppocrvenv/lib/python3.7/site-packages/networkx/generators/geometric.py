    """Returns a random geometric graph in the unit cube of dimensions `dim`.

    The random geometric graph model places `n` nodes uniformly at
    random in the unit cube. Two nodes are joined by an edge if the
    distance between the nodes is at most `radius`.

    Edges are determined using a KDTree when SciPy is available.
    This reduces the time complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int or iterable
        Number of nodes or iterable of nodes
    radius: float
        Distance threshold value
    dim : int, optional
        Dimension of graph
    pos : dict, optional

    p : float, optional
        Which Minkowski distance metric to use.  `p` has to meet the condition
        ``1 <= p <= infinity``.

        If this argument is not specified, the :math:`L^2` metric

        This should not be confused with the `p` of an Erdős-Rényi random

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    Graph
        A random geometric graph, undirected and without self-loops.
        Each node has a node attribute ``'pos'`` that stores the
        position of that node in Euclidean space as provided by the
        ``pos`` keyword argument or, if ``pos`` was not provided, as
        generated by this function.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a random geometric graph on twenty nodes where nodes are joined by
    an edge if their distance is at most 0.1::

    >>> G = nx.random_geometric_graph(20, 0.1)

    Notes
    -----
    This uses a *k*-d tree to build the graph.

    The `pos` keyword argument can be used to specify node positions so you
    can create an arbitrary distribution and domain for positions.

    For example, to use a 2D Gaussian distribution of node positions with mean
    (0, 0) and standard deviation 2::

    >>> import random
    >>> n = 20
    >>> pos = {i: (random.gauss(0, 2), random.gauss(0, 2)) for i in range(n)}
    >>> G = nx.random_geometric_graph(n, 0.2, pos=pos)

    r"""Returns a soft random geometric graph in the unit cube.

    The soft random geometric graph [1] model places `n` nodes uniformly at
    random in the unit cube in dimension `dim`. Two nodes of distance, `dist`,
    computed by the `p`-Minkowski distance metric are joined by an edge with
    probability `p_dist` if the computed distance metric value of the nodes
    is at most `radius`, otherwise they are not joined.

    Edges within `radius` of each other are determined using a KDTree when

        Minkowski distance metric. The probability density function, `p_dist`,
        must be any function that takes the metric value as input
        and outputs a single probability value between 0-1. The scipy.stats
        package has many probability distribution functions implemented and

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)

    Returns
    -------
    Graph
        A soft random geometric graph, undirected and without self-loops.
        Each node has a node attribute ``'pos'`` that stores the
        position of that node in Euclidean space as provided by the
        ``pos`` keyword argument or, if ``pos`` was not provided, as
        generated by this function.

    Examples
    --------
    Default Graph:

    G = nx.soft_random_geometric_graph(50, 0.2)

    Custom Graph:

    Create a soft random geometric graph on 100 uniformly distributed nodes
    where nodes are joined by an edge with probability computed from an
    exponential distribution with rate parameter :math:`\lambda=1` if their
    Euclidean distance is at most 0.2.

    Notes
    -----
    This uses a *k*-d tree to build the graph.

    The `pos` keyword argument can be used to specify node positions so you
    can create an arbitrary distribution and domain for positions.

    For example, to use a 2D Gaussian distribution of node positions with mean
    (0, 0) and standard deviation 2

    The scipy.stats package can be used to define the probability distribution
    with the .pdf method used as `p_dist`.

    Returns
    -------
    Graph
        A random geographic threshold graph, undirected and without

        Each node has a node attribute ``pos`` that stores the
        position of that node in Euclidean space as provided by the

        provided or as generated.

    Examples
    --------
    Specify an alternate distance metric using the ``metric`` keyword
    argument. For example, to use the `taxicab metric`_ instead of the
    default `Euclidean metric`_::

        >>> dist = lambda x, y: sum(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(x, y))

    Notes
    -----
    If weights are not specified they are assigned to nodes by drawing randomly
    from the exponential distribution with rate parameter $\lambda=1$.
    To specify weights from a different distribution, use the `weight` keyword
    argument::

    A navigable small-world graph is a directed grid with additional long-range

    r"""Returns a thresholded random geometric graph in the unit cube.

    The thresholded random geometric graph [1] model places `n` nodes
    uniformly at random in the unit cube of dimensions `dim`. Each node
    `u` is assigned a weight :math:`w_u`. Two nodes `u` and `v` are
    joined by an edge if they are within the maximum connection distance,
    `radius` computed by the `p`-Minkowski distance and the summation of
    weights :math:`w_u` + :math:`w_v` is greater than or equal
    to the threshold parameter `theta`.

    Edges within `radius` of each other are determined using a KDTree when
    SciPy is available. This reduces the time complexity from :math:`O(n^2)`
    to :math:`O(n)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int or iterable
        Number of nodes or iterable of nodes
    radius: float
        Distance threshold value
    theta: float
        Threshold value
    dim : int, optional
        Dimension of graph
    pos : dict, optional
        A dictionary keyed by node with node positions as values.
    weight : dict, optional
        Node weights as a dictionary of numbers keyed by node.
    p : float, optional (default 2)
        Which Minkowski distance metric to use.  `p` has to meet the condition
        ``1 <= p <= infinity``.

        If this argument is not specified, the :math:`L^2` metric
        (the Euclidean distance metric), p = 2 is used.

        This should not be confused with the `p` of an Erdős-Rényi random
        graph, which represents probability.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    Graph
        A thresholded random geographic graph, undirected and without
        self-loops.

        Each node has a node attribute ``'pos'`` that stores the
        position of that node in Euclidean space as provided by the
        ``pos`` keyword argument or, if ``pos`` was not provided, as
        generated by this function. Similarly, each node has a nodethre
        attribute ``'weight'`` that stores the weight of that node as
        provided or as generated.

    Examples
    --------
    Default Graph:

    G = nx.thresholded_random_geometric_graph(50, 0.2, 0.1)

    Custom Graph:

    Create a thresholded random geometric graph on 50 uniformly distributed
    nodes where nodes are joined by an edge if their sum weights drawn from
    a exponential distribution with rate = 5 are >= theta = 0.1 and their
    Euclidean distance is at most 0.2.

    Notes
    -----
    This uses a *k*-d tree to build the graph.

    The `pos` keyword argument can be used to specify node positions so you
    can create an arbitrary distribution and domain for positions.

    For example, to use a 2D Gaussian distribution of node positions with mean
    (0, 0) and standard deviation 2

    If weights are not specified they are assigned to nodes by drawing randomly
    from the exponential distribution with rate parameter :math:`\lambda=1`.
    To specify weights from a different distribution, use the `weight` keyword
    argument::

    ::

    >>> import random
    >>> import math
    >>> n = 50
    >>> pos = {i: (random.gauss(0, 2), random.gauss(0, 2)) for i in range(n)}
    >>> w = {i: random.expovariate(5.0) for i in range(n)}
    >>> G = nx.thresholded_random_geometric_graph(n, 0.2, 0.1, 2, pos, w)
