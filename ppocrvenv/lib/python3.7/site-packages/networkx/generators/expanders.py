    r"""Returns the Margulis-Gabber-Galil undirected MultiGraph on `n^2` nodes.

    The undirected MultiGraph is regular with degree `8`. Nodes are integer
    pairs. The second-largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the graph
    is at most `5 \sqrt{2}`, regardless of `n`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Determines the number of nodes in the graph: `n^2`.
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default MultiGraph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Returns
    -------
    G : graph
        The constructed undirected multigraph.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError

    ----------
    p : a prime number

        The number of vertices in the graph. This also indicates where the

def paley_graph(p, create_using=None):
    """Returns the Paley (p-1)/2-regular graph on p nodes.

    The returned graph is a graph on Z/pZ with edges between x and y
    if and only if x-y is a nonzero square in Z/pZ.

    If p = 1 mod 4, -1 is a square in Z/pZ and therefore x-y is a square if and
    only if y-x is also a square, i.e the edges in the Paley graph are symmetric.

    If p = 3 mod 4, -1 is not a square in Z/pZ and therefore either x-y or y-x
    is a square in Z/pZ but not both.

    Note that a more general definition of Paley graphs extends this construction
    to graphs over q=p^n vertices, by using the finite field F_q instead of Z/pZ.
    This construction requires to compute squares in general finite fields and is
    not what is implemented here (i.e paley_graph(25) does not return the true
    Paley graph associated with 5^2).

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : int, an odd prime number.

    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Returns
    -------
    G : graph
        The constructed directed graph.

    Raises

    NetworkXError
