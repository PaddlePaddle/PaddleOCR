"""
Algorithm for testing d-separation in DAGs.

*d-separation* is a test for conditional independence in probability
distributions that can be factorized using DAGs.  It is a purely
graphical test that uses the underlying graph and makes no reference
to the actual distribution parameters.  See [1]_ for a formal
definition.

The implementation is based on the conceptually simple linear time
algorithm presented in [2]_.  Refer to [3]_, [4]_ for a couple of
alternative algorithms.


Examples
--------

>>>
>>> # HMM graph with five states and observation nodes
... g = nx.DiGraph()
>>> g.add_edges_from(
...     [
...         ("S1", "S2"),
...         ("S2", "S3"),
...         ("S3", "S4"),
...         ("S4", "S5"),
...         ("S1", "O1"),
...         ("S2", "O2"),
...         ("S3", "O3"),
...         ("S4", "O4"),
...         ("S5", "O5"),
...     ]
... )
>>>
>>> # states/obs before 'S3' are d-separated from states/obs after 'S3'
... nx.d_separated(g, {"S1", "S2", "O1", "O2"}, {"S4", "S5", "O4", "O5"}, {"S3"})
True

    Return whether node sets ``x`` and ``y`` are d-separated by ``z``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A NetworkX DAG.

    x : set
        First set of nodes in ``G``.

    y : set
        Second set of nodes in ``G``.

    z : set
        Set of conditioning nodes in ``G``. Can be empty set.

    b : bool
        A boolean that is true if ``x`` is d-separated from ``y`` given ``z`` in ``G``.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        The *d-separation* test is commonly used with directed
        graphical models which are acyclic.  Accordingly, the algorithm
        raises a :exc:`NetworkXError` if the input graph is not a DAG.

    NodeNotFound
        If any of the input nodes are not found in the graph,
        a :exc:`NodeNotFound` exception is raised.
