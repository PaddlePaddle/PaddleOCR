Description: # cython_bbox
        
        cython_bbox is widely used in object detection tasks. To my best knowledge, it was first implemented in [Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn). Since then, almost all object detection projects use the source code directly.
        
        In order to use it in standalone code snippets or small projects, I make it a pypi module. The `cython_bbox.pyx` is totally borrowed from [Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn). Thanks [RBG](http://www.rossgirshick.info/)!

        ## usage
        
        
        ```
        from cython_bbox import bbox_overlaps
        overlaps = bbox_overlaps(
                np.ascontiguousarray(dt, dtype=np.float32),
                np.ascontiguousarray(gt, dtype=np.float32)
            )
