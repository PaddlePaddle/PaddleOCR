    This warning occurs when some input data needs to be converted or
    interpreted in a way that may not match the user's expectations.

    For example, this warning may occur when the user
        - passes an integer array to a function which expects float input and
          will convert the input
        - requests a non-copying operation, but a copy is required to meet the
          implementation's data-type expectations;

    For example, in random projection, this warning is raised when the
    number of components, which quantifies the dimensionality of the target
    projection space, is higher than the number of features, which quantifies
    the dimensionality of the original source space, to imply that the
    dimensionality of the problem will not be reduced.
