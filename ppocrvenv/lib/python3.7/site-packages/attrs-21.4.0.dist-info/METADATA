``attrs`` is the Python package that will bring back the **joy** of **writing classes** by relieving you from the drudgery of implementing object protocols (aka `dunder methods <https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/glossary.html#term-dunder-methods>`_).
`Trusted by NASA <https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#list-of-qualifying-repositories-for-mars-2020-helicopter-contributor-badge>`_ for Mars missions since 2020!

Its main goal is to help you to write **concise** and **correct** software without slowing down your code.

.. teaser-end

For that, it gives you a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class:

.. -code-begin-

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> from attrs import asdict, define, make_class, Factory

   >>> @define
   ... class SomeClass:
   ...     a_number: int = 42
   ...     list_of_numbers: list[int] = Factory(list)
   ...
   ...     def hard_math(self, another_number):
   ...         return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number


   >>> sc = SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   >>> sc
   SomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])

   >>> sc.hard_math(3)
   19
   >>> sc == SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   True
   >>> sc != SomeClass(2, [3, 2, 1])
   True

   >>> asdict(sc)
   {'a_number': 1, 'list_of_numbers': [1, 2, 3]}

   >>> SomeClass()
   SomeClass(a_number=42, list_of_numbers=[])

   >>> C = make_class("C", ["a", "b"])
   >>> C("foo", "bar")
   C(a='foo', b='bar')


After *declaring* your attributes ``attrs`` gives you:

- a concise and explicit overview of the class's attributes,
- a nice human-readable ``__repr__``,
- a equality-checking methods,
- an initializer,
- and much more,

*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again and *without* runtime performance penalties.

**Hate type annotations**!?
No problem!
Types are entirely **optional** with ``attrs``.
Simply assign ``attrs.field()`` to the attributes instead of annotating them with types.

----

This example uses ``attrs``'s modern APIs that have been introduced in version 20.1.0, and the ``attrs`` package import name that has been added in version 21.3.0.
The classic APIs (``@attr.s``, ``attr.ib``, plus their serious business aliases) and the ``attr`` package import name will remain **indefinitely**.

Please check out `On The Core API Names <https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/names.html>`_ for a more in-depth explanation.


Data Classes
============

On the tin, ``attrs`` might remind you of ``dataclasses`` (and indeed, ``dataclasses`` are a descendant of ``attrs``).
In practice it does a lot more and is more flexible.
For instance it allows you to define `special handling of NumPy arrays for equality checks <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/comparison.html#customization>`_, or allows more ways to `plug into the initialization process <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/init.html#hooking-yourself-into-initialization>`_.

For more details, please refer to our `comparison page <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#data-classes>`_.

Credits
=======

``attrs`` is written and maintained by `Hynek Schlawack <https://hynek.me/>`_.

The development is kindly supported by `Variomedia AG <https://www.variomedia.de/>`_.

A full list of contributors can be found in `GitHub's overview <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/graphs/contributors>`_.

It’s the spiritual successor of `characteristic <https://characteristic.readthedocs.io/>`_ and aspires to fix some of it clunkiness and unfortunate decisions.
Both were inspired by Twisted’s `FancyEqMixin <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.util.FancyEqMixin.html>`_ but both are implemented using class decorators because `subclassing is bad for you <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MNVP9-hglc>`_, m’kay?
