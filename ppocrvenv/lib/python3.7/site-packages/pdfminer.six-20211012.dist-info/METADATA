*We fathom PDF*

Pdfminer.six is a community maintained fork of the original PDFMiner. It is a tool for extracting information from PDF
documents. It focuses on getting and analyzing text data. Pdfminer.six extracts the text from a page directly from the
sourcecode of the PDF. It can also be used to get the exact location, font or color of the text.

It is built in a modular way such that each component of pdfminer.six can be replaced easily. You can implement your own
interpreter or rendering device that uses the power of pdfminer.six for other purposes than text analysis.
