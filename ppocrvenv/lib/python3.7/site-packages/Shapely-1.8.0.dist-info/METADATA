Shapely is a BSD-licensed Python package for manipulation and analysis of
planar geometric objects. It is based on the widely deployed `GEOS
<https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/>`__ (the engine of `PostGIS
<http://postgis.org>`__) and `JTS
<https://locationtech.github.io/jts/>`__ (from which GEOS is ported)
libraries. Shapely is not concerned with data formats or coordinate systems,
but can be readily integrated with packages that are. For more details, see:

* `Shapely GitHub repository <https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely>`__
* `Shapely documentation and manual <https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

Usage
=====

Here is the canonical example of building an approximately circular patch by
buffering a point.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from shapely.geometry import Point
    >>> patch = Point(0.0, 0.0).buffer(10.0)
    >>> patch
    <shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at 0x...>
    >>> patch.area
    313.65484905459385

See the manual for more examples and guidance.

Requirements
============

Shapely 1.8 requires

* Python >=3.6
* GEOS >=3.3

Installing Shapely
==================

Shapely may be installed from a source distribution or one of several kinds
of built distribution.

Built distributions
-------------------

Built distributions are the only option for users who do not have or do not
know how to use their platform's compiler and Python SDK, and a good option for
users who would rather not bother.

Linux, OS X, and Windows users can get Shapely wheels with GEOS included from the
Python Package Index with a recent version of pip (8+):

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install shapely

Shapely is available via system package management tools like apt, yum, and
Homebrew, and is also provided by popular Python distributions like Canopy and
Anaconda. If you use the Conda package manager to install Shapely, be sure to
use the conda-forge channel.

Windows users have another good installation options: the wheels published at
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely. These can be installed
using pip by specifying the entire URL.

Source distributions
--------------------

If you want to build Shapely from source for compatibility with other modules
that depend on GEOS (such as cartopy or osgeo.ogr) or want to use a different
version of GEOS than the one included in the project wheels you should first
install the GEOS library, Cython, and Numpy on your system (using apt, yum,
brew, or other means) and then direct pip to ignore the binary wheels.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install shapely --no-binary shapely

If you've installed GEOS to a standard location, the geos-config program will
be used to get compiler and linker options. If geos-config is not on your
executable, it can be specified with a GEOS_CONFIG environment variable, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

    $ GEOS_CONFIG=/path/to/geos-config pip install shapely

Integration
===========

Shapely does not read or write data files, but it can serialize and deserialize
using several well known formats and protocols. The shapely.wkb and shapely.wkt
modules provide dumpers and loaders inspired by Python's pickle module.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from shapely.wkt import dumps, loads
    >>> dumps(loads('POINT (0 0)'))
    'POINT (0.0000000000000000 0.0000000000000000)'

Shapely can also integrate with other Python GIS packages using GeoJSON-like
dicts.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import json
    >>> from shapely.geometry import mapping, shape
    >>> s = shape(json.loads('{"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.0, 0.0]}'))
    >>> s
    <shapely.geometry.point.Point object at 0x...>
    >>> print(json.dumps(mapping(s)))
    {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.0, 0.0]}

Development and Testing
=======================

Dependencies for developing Shapely are listed in requirements-dev.txt. Cython
and Numpy are not required for production installations, only for development.
Use of a virtual environment is strongly recommended.

.. code-block:: console

    $ virtualenv .
    $ source bin/activate
    (env)$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    (env)$ pip install -e .

The project uses pytest to run Shapely's suite of unittests and doctests.

.. code-block:: console

    (env)$ python -m pytest

Changes
=======

1.8.0 (2021-10-25)
------------------

This is the final 1.8.0 release. There have been no changes since 1.8rc2.

1.8rc2 (2021-10-19)
-------------------

Build:

A pyproject.toml file has been added to specify build dependencies for the
_vectorized and _speedups modules (#1128). To install shapely without these
build dependencies, use the features of your build tool that disable PEP 517
and 518 support.

Bug fixes:

- Part of PR #1042, which added a new primary GEOS library name to be searched
  for, has been reverted by PR #1201.

1.8rc1 (2021-10-04)
-------------------

Deprecations:

The almost_exact() method of BaseGeometry has been deprecated. It is confusing
and will be removed in 2.0.0. The equals_exact() method is to be used instead.

Bug fixes:

- We ensure that the _speedups module is always imported before _vectorized to
  avoid an unexplained condition on Windows with Python 3.8 and 3.9 (#1184).

1.8a3 (2021-08-24)
------------------

Deprecations:

The STRtree class deprecation warnings have been removed. The class in 2.0.0
will be backwards compatible with the class in 1.8.0.

Bug fixes:

- The __array_interface__ raises only AttributeError, all other exceptions are
  deprecated starting with Numpy 1.21 (#1173).
- The STRtree class now uses a pair of item, geom sequences internally instead
  of a dict (#1177).


1.8a2 (2021-07-15)
------------------

Python version support:

Shapely 1.8 will support only Python versions >= 3.6.

New features:

- The STRtree nearest*() methods now take an optional argument that
  specifies exclusion of the input geometry from results (#1115).
- A GeometryTypeError has been added to shapely.errors and is consistently
  raised instead of TypeError or ValueError as in version 1.7. For backwards
  compatibility, the new exception will derive from TypeError and Value error
  until version 2.0 (#1099).
- The STRtree class constructor now takes an optional second argument, a
  sequence of objects to be stored in the tree. If not provided, the sequence
  indices of the geometries will be stored, as before (#1112).
- The STRtree class has new query_geoms(), query_items(), nearest_geom(), and
  nearest_item() methods (#1112). The query() and nearest() methods remain as
  aliases for query_geoms() and nearest_geom().

Bug fixes:

- We no longer attempt to load libc to get the free function on Linux, but get
  it from the global symbol table.
- GEOS error messages printed when GEOS_getCoordSeq() is passed an empty
  geometry are avoided by never passing an empty geometry (#1134).
- Python's builtin super() is now used only as described in PEP 3135 (#1109).
- Only load conda GEOS dll if it exists (on Windows) (#1108).
- Add /opt/homebrew/lib to the list of directories to be searched for the GEOS
  shared library.
- Added new library search path to assist app creation with cx_Freeze.

1.8a1 (2021-03-03)
------------------

Shapely 1.8.0 will be a transitional version. There are a few bug fixes and new
features, but it is mainly about warning of the upcoming changes in 2.0.0.
Several more pre-releases before 1.8.0 are expected. See the migration guide
to Shapely 1.8 / 2.0 for more details on how to update your code
(https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration.html).

Python version support:

Shapely 1.8 will support only Python versions >= 3.5 (#884).

Deprecations:

The following functions and geometry attributes and methods will be removed in
version 2.0.0.

- ops.cascaded_union
- geometry .empty()
- geometry .ctypes and .__array_interface__
- multi-part geometry .__len__
- setting custom attributes on geometry objects

Geometry objects will become immutable in version 2.0.0.

The STRtree class will be entirely changed in 2.0.0. The exact future API is
not yet decided, but will be decided before 1.8.0 is released.

Deprecation warnings will be emitted in 1.8a1 when any of these features are
used.

The deprecated .to_wkb() and .to_wkt() methods on the geometry objects have
been removed.

New features:

- Add a normalize() method to geometry classes, exposing the GEOSNormalize
  algorithm (#1090).
- Initialize STRtree with a capacity of 10 items per node (#1070).
- Load libraries relocated to shapely/.libs by auditwheel versions < 3.1 or
  relocated to Shapely.libs by auditwheel versions >= 3.1.
- shapely.ops.voronoi_diagram() computes the Voronoi Diagram of a geometry or
  geometry collection (#833, #851).
- shapely.validation.make_valid() fixes invalid geometries (#883)

Bug fixes:

- For pyinstaller we now handle the case of more than one GEOS library in the
  environment, such as when fiona and rasterio wheels are co-installed with
  shapely (#1071).
- The ops.split function now splits on touch to eliminate confusing
  discrepancies between results using multi and single part splitters (#1034).
- Several issues with duplication and order of vertices in ops.substring have
  been fixed (#1008).

Packaging:

- The wheels uploaded to PyPI will include GEOS 3.9.1.

1.7.1 (2020-08-20)
------------------

- ``STRtree`` now safely implements the pickle protocol (#915).
- Documentation has been added for ``minimum_clearance`` (#875, #874).
- In ``STRtree.__del__()`` we guard against calling ``GEOSSTRtree_destroy``
  when the lgeos module has already been torn down on exit (#897, #830).
- Documentation for the ``overlaps()`` method has been corrected (#920).
- Correct the test in ``shapely.geometry.base.BaseGeometry.empty()`` to
  eliminate memory leaks like the one reported in #745.
- Get free() not from libc but from the processes global symbols (#891),
  fixing a bug that manifests on OS X 10.15 and 10.16.
- Extracting substrings from complex lines has been made more correct (#848,
  #849).
- Splitting of complex geometries has been sped up by preparing the input
  geometry (#871).
- Fix bug in concatenation of function argtypes (#866).
- Improved documentation of STRtree usage (#857).
- Improved handling for empty list or list of lists in GeoJSON coordinates
  (#852).
- The polylabel algorithm now accounts for polygon holes (#851, #817).

1.7.0 (2020-01-28)
------------------

This is the final 1.7.0 release. There have been no changes since 1.7b1.

1.7b1 (2020-01-13)
------------------

First beta release.

1.7a3 (2019-12-31)
------------------

New features:

- The buffer operation can now be single-sides (#806, #727).

Bug fixes:

- Add /usr/local/lib to the list of directories to be searched for the GEOS
  shared library (#795).
- ops.substring now returns a line with coords in end-to-front order when given
  a start position that is greater than the end position (#628).
- Implement ``__bool__()`` for geometry base classes so that ``bool(geom)``
  returns the logical complement of ``geom.is_empty`` (#754).
- Remove assertion on the number of version-like strings found in the GEOS
  version string. It could be 2 or 3.

1.7a2 (2019-06-21)
------------------

- Nearest neighbor search has been added to STRtree (#668).
- Disallow sequences of MultiPolygons as arguments to the MultiPolygon
  constructor, resolving #588.
- Removed vendorized `functools` functions previously used to support
  Python 2.5.

Bug fixes:

- Avoid reloading the GEOS shared library when using an installed binary wheel
  on OS X (#735), resolving issue #553.
- The shapely.ops.orient function can now orient multi polygons and geometry
  collections as well as polygons (#733).
- Polygons can now be constructed from sequences of point objects as well as
  sequences of x, y sequences (#732).
- The exterior of an empty polygon is now equal to an empty linear ring (#731).
- The bounds property of an empty point object now returns an empty tuple,
  consistent with other geometry types (#723).
- Segmentation faults when non-string values are passed to the WKT loader are
  avoided by #700.
- Failure of ops.substring when the sub linestring coincides with the beginning
  of the linestring has been fixed (#658).
- Segmentation faults from interpolating on an empty linestring are prevented
  by #655.
- A missing special case for rectangular polygons has been added to the
  polylabel algorithm (#644).
- LinearRing can be created from a LineString (#638).
- The prepared geoemtry validation condition has been tightened in #632 to fix
  the bug reported in #631.
- Attempting to interpolate an empty geometry no longer results in a
  segmentation fault, raising `ValueError` instead (#653).

1.7a1 (2018-07-29)
------------------

New features:

- A Python version check is made by the package setup script. Shapely 1.7
  supports only Python versions 2.7 and 3.4+ (#610).
- Added a new `EmptyGeometry` class to support GeoPandas (#514).
- Added new `shapely.ops.substring` function (#459).
- Added new `shapely.ops.clip_by_rect` function (#583).
- Use DLLs indicated in sys._MEIPASS' to support PyInstaller frozen apps
  (#523).
- `shapely.wkb.dumps` now accepts an `srid` integer keyword argument to write
  WKB data including a spatial reference ID in the output data (#593).

Bug fixes:

- `shapely.geometry.shape` can now marshal empty GeoJSON representations
  (#573).
- An exception is raised when an attempt is made to `prepare`
  a `PreparedGeometry` (#577, #595).
- Keyword arguments have been removed from a geometry object's `wkt` property
  getter (#581, #594).

1.6.4.post1 (2018-01-24)
------------------------

- Fix broken markup in this change log, which restores our nicely formatted
  readme on PyPI.

1.6.4 (2018-01-24)
------------------

- Handle a ``TypeError`` that can occur when geometries are torn down (#473,
  #528).


1.6.3 (2017-12-09)
------------------

- AttributeError is no longer raised when accessing __geo_interface__ of an
  empty polygon (#450).
- ``asShape`` now handles empty coordinates in mappings as ``shape`` does
  (#542). Please note that ``asShape`` is likely to be deprecated in a future
  version of Shapely.
- Check for length of LineString coordinates in speed mode, preventing crashes
  when using LineStrings with only one coordinate (#546).

1.6.2 (2017-10-30)
------------------

- A 1.6.2.post1 release has been made to fix a problem with macosx wheels
  uploaded to PyPI.

1.6.2 (2017-10-26)
------------------

- Splitting a linestring by one of its end points will now succeed instead of
  failing with a ``ValueError`` (#524, #533).
- Missing documentation of a geometry's ``overlaps`` predicate has been added
  (#522).

1.6.1 (2017-09-01)
------------------

- Avoid ``STRTree`` crashes due to dangling references (#505) by maintaining
  references to added geometries.
- Reduce log level to debug when reporting on calls to ctypes ``CDLL()`` that
  don't succeed and are retried (#515).
- Clarification: applications like GeoPandas that need an empty geometry object
  should use ``BaseGeometry()`` instead of ``Point()`` or ``Polygon()``. An
  ``EmptyGeometry`` class has been added in the master development branch and
  will be available in the next non-bugfix release.

1.6.0 (2017-08-21)
------------------

Shapely 1.6.0 adds new attributes to existing geometry classes and new
functions (``split()`` and ``polylabel()``) to the shapely.ops module.
Exceptions are consolidated in a shapely.errors module and logging practices
have been improved. Shapely's optional features depending on Numpy are now
gathered into a requirements set named "vectorized" and these may be installed
like ``pip install shapely[vectorized]``.

Much of the work on 1.6.0 was aimed to improve the project's build and
packaging scripts and to minimize run-time dependencies. Shapely now vendorizes
packaging to use during builds only and never again invokes the geos-config
utility at run-time.

In addition to the changes listed under the alpha and beta pre-releases below,
the following change has been made to the project:

- Project documentation is now hosted at 
  https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Thank you all for using, promoting, and contributing to the Shapely project.

1.6b5 (2017-08-18)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Passing a single coordinate to ``LineString()`` with speedups disabled now
