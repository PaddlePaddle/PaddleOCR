            and post-precess of MHA and FFN sub-layer. Default 0.1
        activation (str, optional): The activation function in the feedforward
            network. Default relu.

            `dropout`. Default None
        act_dropout (float, optional): The dropout probability used after FFN
            activition.  If None, use the value of `dropout`. Default None
        normalize_before (bool, optional): Indicate whether to put layer normalization
            into preprocessing of MHA and FFN sub-layers. If True, pre-process is layer
            normalization and post-precess includes dropout, residual connection.
            Otherwise, no pre-process and post-precess includes dropout, residual
            connection, layer normalization. Default False
        weight_attr(ParamAttr|list|tuple, optional): To specify the weight parameter property.
            If it is a list/tuple, the length of `weight_attr` could be 1, 2 or 3. If it is 3, 
            `weight_attr[0]` would be used as `weight_attr` for self attention, `weight_attr[1]` 
            would be used as `weight_attr` for cross attention of `TransformerDecoder`, 
            and `weight_attr[2]` would be used as `weight_attr` for linear in FFN. 
            If it is 2, `weight_attr[0]` would be used as `weight_attr` both for self attention 
            and cross attntion and `weight_attr[1]` would be used as `weight_attr` for 
            linear in FFN. If it is 1, `weight_attr[0]` would be used as `weight_attr` 
            for self attention, cross attention and linear in FFN. Otherwise, 
            the three sub-layers all uses it as `weight_attr` to create parameters. 
            Default: None, which means the default weight parameter property is used.

            in :code:`ParamAttr` . 
        bias_attr (ParamAttr|list|tuple|bool, optional): To specify the bias parameter property.
            If it is a list/tuple, the length of `bias_attr` could be 1, 2 or 3. If it is 3, 
            `bias_attr[0]` would be used as `bias_attr` for self attention, `bias_attr[1]` 
            would be used as `bias_attr` for cross attention of `TransformerDecoder`, 
            and `bias_attr[2]` would be used as `bias_attr` for linear in FFN.

            and cross attntion and `bias_attr[1]` would be used as `bias_attr` for 
            linear in FFN. If it is 1, `bias_attr[0]` would be used as `bias_attr` 
            for self attention, cross attention and linear in FFN. Otherwise, 
            the three sub-layers all uses it as `bias_attr` to create parameters. 
            The `False` value means the corresponding layer would not have trainable 
            bias parameter. See usage for details in :code:`ParamAttr` . 
            Default: None,which means the default bias parameter property is used.
        custom_encoder (Layer, optional): If custom encoder is provided, use it as the encoder.
            Default None
        custom_decoder (Layer, optional): If custom decoder is provided, use it as the decoder.
            Default None

                values. When the data type is float, the unwanted positions have 
                `-INF` values and the others have 0 values. It can be None when 
                nothing wanted or needed to be prevented attention to. Default None.
            memory_mask (Tensor, optional): A tensor used in decoder-encoder
                cross attention to prevents attention to some unwanted positions,
                usually the paddings. It is a tensor with shape broadcasted to
                `[batch_size, n_head, target_length, source_length]`. When the 
                data type is bool, the unwanted positions have `False` values 
                and the others have `True` values. When the data type is int,
