                  use="conv"):
    """Compute the coefficients for a 1-D Savitzky-Golay FIR filter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window_length : int
        The length of the filter window (i.e., the number of coefficients).
        `window_length` must be an odd positive integer.
    polyorder : int
        The order of the polynomial used to fit the samples.
        `polyorder` must be less than `window_length`.
    deriv : int, optional
        The order of the derivative to compute. This must be a
        nonnegative integer. The default is 0, which means to filter
        the data without differentiating.
    delta : float, optional
        The spacing of the samples to which the filter will be applied.
        This is only used if deriv > 0.
    pos : int or None, optional
        If pos is not None, it specifies evaluation position within the
        window. The default is the middle of the window.
    use : str, optional
        Either 'conv' or 'dot'. This argument chooses the order of the
        coefficients. The default is 'conv', which means that the
        coefficients are ordered to be used in a convolution. With
        use='dot', the order is reversed, so the filter is applied by
        dotting the coefficients with the data set.

    Returns
    -------
    coeffs : 1-D ndarray
        The filter coefficients.

    This is a 1-D filter. If `x`  has dimension greater than 1, `axis`
    determines the axis along which the filter is applied.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The data to be filtered. If `x` is not a single or double precision
        floating point array, it will be converted to type ``numpy.float64``
        before filtering.
    window_length : int
        The length of the filter window (i.e., the number of coefficients).
        `window_length` must be a positive odd integer. If `mode` is 'interp',
        `window_length` must be less than or equal to the size of `x`.
    polyorder : int
        The order of the polynomial used to fit the samples.
        `polyorder` must be less than `window_length`.
    deriv : int, optional
        The order of the derivative to compute. This must be a
        nonnegative integer. The default is 0, which means to filter
        the data without differentiating.
    delta : float, optional
        The spacing of the samples to which the filter will be applied.
        This is only used if deriv > 0. Default is 1.0.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis of the array `x` along which the filter is to be applied.
        Default is -1.
    mode : str, optional
        Must be 'mirror', 'constant', 'nearest', 'wrap' or 'interp'. This
        determines the type of extension to use for the padded signal to
        which the filter is applied.  When `mode` is 'constant', the padding
        value is given by `cval`.  See the Notes for more details on 'mirror',
        'constant', 'wrap', and 'nearest'.
        When the 'interp' mode is selected (the default), no extension
        is used.  Instead, a degree `polyorder` polynomial is fit to the
        last `window_length` values of the edges, and this polynomial is
        used to evaluate the last `window_length // 2` output values.
    cval : scalar, optional
        Value to fill past the edges of the input if `mode` is 'constant'.
        Default is 0.0.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray, same shape as `x`
        The filtered data.

    Notes
    -----
    Details on the `mode` options:

        'mirror':
            Repeats the values at the edges in reverse order. The value
            closest to the edge is not included.
        'nearest':
            The extension contains the nearest input value.
        'constant':
            The extension contains the value given by the `cval` argument.
        'wrap':
            The extension contains the values from the other end of the array.

    For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], and
    `window_length` is 7, the following shows the extended data for
    the various `mode` options (assuming `cval` is 0)::

        mode       |   Ext   |         Input          |   Ext
        -----------+---------+------------------------+---------
        'mirror'   | 4  3  2 | 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 | 7  6  5
        'nearest'  | 1  1  1 | 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 | 8  8  8
        'constant' | 0  0  0 | 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 | 0  0  0
        'wrap'     | 6  7  8 | 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 | 1  2  3
