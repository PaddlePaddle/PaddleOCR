A typical scenario is vertical oriented structured Text Recognition widely used in daily life, such as license plate recognition, bank card information recognition, ID card information recognition, train ticket information recognition and so on. The common feature of these small vertical classes is that the format is fixed, so it is very suitable to use OCR technology for automation, which can greatly reduce labor cost and improve efficiency.\n",

There are generally two modes for end-side OCR applications: upload to the server vs. end-side direct identification. Considering that the way of uploading to the server requires the network, low real-time performance, high pressure on the server when the amount of requests is too large, and the security of data transmission, we hope to complete OCR identification directly on the end side, The storage space and computing power on the end side are limited, so there are high requirements for the size and prediction speed of OCR model.\n",

    "\n",
    "The task of text detection is to locate the text area in the input image. In recent years, the academic research on text detection is very rich. One kind of methods regard text detection as a specific scene in target detection, and improve the adaptation based on the general target detection algorithm. For example, textboxes [1] adjusts the target frame to fit the text line with extreme aspect ratio based on the one-stage target detector SSD [2], Ctpn [3] is improved based on the fast RCNN [4] architecture. However, there are still some differences between text detection and target detection in target information and task itself. For example, text is generally large in length and width, often in a \"strip\", and text lines may be dense, bending text, etc. Therefore, many algorithms dedicated to text detection have been derived, such as East [5], psenet [6], dbnet [7], etc.\n",

    "At present, the more popular text detection algorithms can be roughly divided into two categories: **based on regression** and **based on segmentation**, and some algorithms combine the two. The regression based algorithm draws lessons from the general object detection algorithm. By setting the anchor regression detection box or directly doing pixel regression, this kind of method has better detection effect on regular shaped text, but relatively poor detection effect on irregular shaped text. For example, ctpn [3] has better detection effect on horizontal text, but poor detection effect on inclined and curved text, Seglink [8] is good for long text, but poor for text with sparse distribution; The segmentation based algorithm introduces mask RCNN [9], which can achieve a higher level in the detection effect of various scenes and texts of various shapes, but the disadvantage is that the post-processing is generally complex, so there are often speed problems and can not solve the detection problem of overlapping texts.\n",

Text Recognition can generally be divided into **regular text recognition** and **irregular text recognition** according to the shape of the text to be recognized. Regular text mainly refers to printed font, scanned text, etc., and the text is roughly in the horizontal line position; Irregular text is often not in the horizontal position, and there are problems such as bending, occlusion, blur and so on. Irregular text scene is very challenging, and it is also the main research direction in the field of text tecognition.\n",

    "According to different decoding methods, the algorithms of regular Text Recognition can be roughly divided into two types: CTC based and sequence2sequence based. The processing methods of transforming the sequence features learned by the network into the final recognition results are different. The CTC based algorithm is represented by the classical crnn [11].\n",

OCR result + post-processing is a common structured scheme, but the process is often complex, and the post-processing needs fine design and poor generalization. With the gradual maturity of OCR technology and the increasing demand for structured information extraction, various technologies on intelligent document analysis, such as layout analysis, table recognition and key information extraction, have attracted more and more attention and research.\n",

For example, Soto Carlos [16] improves the region detection performance by combining the context information and using the inherent location information of the document content on the basis of the target detection algorithm fast r-cnn; Sarkar mausoom [17] and others proposed a priori based segmentation mechanism to train the document segmentation model on very high-resolution images, which solves the problem that different structures of dense regions cannot be distinguished and then merged due to excessive reduction of the original image.\n",

Based on graph neural network, table recognition is regarded as a graph reconstruction problem, such as tgrnet proposed by Xue Wenyuan [21]; The end-to-end method directly uses the network to complete the HTML representation output of the table structure. Most end-to-end methods use the seq2seq method to complete the prediction of the table structure, such as some methods based on attention or transformer, such as tablemaster [22].\n",

It is suitable for deploying complex models with multiple application language environments on high-performance hardware, The hardware covers x86 CPU, NVIDIA GPU, baidu Kunlun XPU, Huawei shengteng and other AI accelerators.\n",
