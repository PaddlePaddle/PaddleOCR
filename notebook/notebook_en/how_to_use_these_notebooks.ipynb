    "# 1. Course Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "The OCR model involved in this course is based on deep learning, so its related basic knowledge, environment configuration, project engineering and other materials will be introduced in this section, especially for readers who are not familiar with deep learning. content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Preliminary Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"learning\" of deep learning has been developed from the content of neurons, perceptrons, and multilayer neural networks in machine learning. Therefore, understanding the basic machine learning algorithms is of great help to the understanding and application of deep learning. The \"deepness\" of deep learning is embodied in a series of vector-based mathematical operations such as convolution and pooling used in the process of processing a large amount of information. If you lack the theoretical foundation of the two, you can learn from teacher Li Hongyi's [Linear Algebra](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/course/introduce/2063) and [Machine Learning](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/course/introduce/1978) courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the understanding of deep learning itself, you can refer to the zero-based course of Bai Ran, an outstanding architect of Baidu: [Baidu architects take you hands-on with zero-based practice deep learning](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/course/introduce/1297), which covers the development history of deep learning and introduces the complete components of deep learning through a classic case. It is a set of practice-oriented deep learning courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the practice of theoretical knowledge, [Python basic knowledge](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/course/introduce/1224) is essential. At the same time, in order to quickly reproduce the deep learning model, the deep learning framework used in this course For: Flying PaddlePaddle. If you have used other frameworks, you can quickly learn how to use flying paddles through [Quick Start Document](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/documentation/docs/zh/practices/quick_start/hello_paddle.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Basic Environment Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run the code of this course in a local environment and have not built a Python environment before, you can follow the [zero-base operating environment preparation](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/blob/release/2.3/doc/doc_ch/environment.md), install Anaconda or docker environment according to your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have local resources, you can run the code through the AI Studio training platform. Each item in it is presented in a notebook, which is convenient for developers to learn. If you are not familiar with the related operations of Notebook, you can refer to [AI Studio Project Description](https://ai.baidu.com/ai-doc/AISTUDIO/0k3e2tfzm).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Get and Run the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This course relies on the formation of PaddleOCR's code repository. First, clone the complete project of PaddleOCR:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# [recommend]\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR\n",
    "\n",
    "# If you cannot pull successfully due to network problems, you can also choose to use the hosting on Code Cloud:\n",
    "git clone https://gitee.com/paddlepaddle/PaddleOCR\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The code cloud hosted code may not be able to synchronize the update of this github project in real time, there is a delay of 3~5 days, please use the recommended method first.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If you are not familiar with git operations, you can download the compressed package directly from the `Code` on the homepage of PaddleOCR\n",
    "\n",
    "Then install third-party libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd PaddleOCR\n",
    "pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Access to Information\n",
    "\n",
    "[PaddleOCR Usage Document](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/blob/release/2.3/README.md) describes in detail how to use PaddleOCR to complete model application, training and deployment. The document is rich in content, most of the userâ€™s questions are described in the document or FAQ, especially in [FAQ](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/blob/release%2F2.3/doc/doc_en/FAQ_en.md), in accordance with the application process of deep learning, has precipitated the user's common questions, it is recommended that you read it carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Ask for Help\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter BUG, ease of use or documentation related issues while using PaddleOCR, you can contact the official via [Github issue](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/issues), please follow the issue template Provide as much information as possible so that official personnel can quickly locate the problem. At the same time, the WeChat group is the daily communication position for the majority of PaddleOCR users, and it is more suitable for asking some consulting questions. In addition to the PaddleOCR team members, there will also be enthusiastic developers answering your questions."
