# PaddleOCR Document Parsing Skill

## When to Use This Skill

**Use Document Parsing for**:
- Documents with tables (invoices, financial reports, spreadsheets)
- Documents with mathematical formulas (academic papers, scientific documents)
- Documents with charts and diagrams
- Multi-column layouts (newspapers, magazines, brochures)
- Complex document structures requiring layout analysis
- Any document requiring structured understanding

**Use Text Recognition instead for**:
- Simple text-only extraction
- Quick OCR tasks where speed is critical
- Screenshots or simple images with clear text

## How to Use This Skill

**⛔ MANDATORY RESTRICTIONS - DO NOT VIOLATE ⛔**

1. **ONLY use PaddleOCR Document Parsing API** - Execute the script `python scripts/vl_caller.py`
2. **NEVER parse documents directly** - Do NOT parse documents yourself
3. **NEVER offer alternatives** - Do NOT suggest "I can try to analyze it" or similar
4. **IF API fails** - Display the error message and STOP immediately
5. **NO fallback methods** - Do NOT attempt document parsing any other way

If the script execution fails (API not configured, network error, etc.):
- Show the error message to the user
- Do NOT offer to help using your vision capabilities
- Do NOT ask "Would you like me to try parsing it?"
- Simply stop and wait for user to fix the configuration

### Basic Workflow

1. **Execute document parsing**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/vl_caller.py --file-url "URL provided by user" --pretty
   ```
   Or for local files:
   ```bash
   python scripts/vl_caller.py --file-path "file path" --pretty
   ```

   **Optional: explicitly set file type**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/vl_caller.py --file-url "URL provided by user" --file-type 0 --pretty
   ```
   - `--file-type 0`: PDF
   - `--file-type 1`: image
   - If omitted, the service can infer file type from input.

   **Default behavior: save raw JSON to a temp file**:
   - If `--output` is omitted, the script saves automatically under the system temp directory
   - Default path pattern: `<system-temp>/paddleocr/doc-parsing/results/result_<timestamp>_<id>.json`
   - If `--output` is provided, it overrides the default temp-file destination
   - If `--stdout` is provided, JSON is printed to stdout and no file is saved
   - In save mode, the script prints the absolute saved path on stderr: `Result saved to: /absolute/path/...`
   - In default/custom save mode, read and parse the saved JSON file before responding
   - In save mode, always tell the user the saved file path and that full raw JSON is available there
   - Use `--stdout` only when you explicitly want to skip file persistence

2. **The output JSON contains COMPLETE content** with all document data:
   - Headers, footers, page numbers
   - Main text content
   - Tables with structure
   - Formulas (with LaTeX)
   - Figures and charts
   - Footnotes and references
   - Seals and stamps
   - Layout and reading order

   **Input type note**:
   - Supported file types depend on the model and endpoint configuration.
   - Always follow the file type constraints documented by your endpoint API.

3. **Extract what the user needs** from the output JSON using these fields:
   - Top-level `text`
   - `result[n].markdown`
   - `result[n].prunedResult`

### IMPORTANT: Complete Content Display

**CRITICAL**: You must display the COMPLETE extracted content to the user based on their needs.

- The output JSON contains ALL document content in a structured format
- In save mode, the raw provider result can be inspected in the saved JSON file
- **Display the full content requested by the user**, do NOT truncate or summarize
- If user asks for "all text", show the entire `text` field
- If user asks for "tables", show ALL tables in the document
- If user asks for "main content", filter out headers/footers but show ALL body text

**What this means**:
- **DO**: Display complete text, all tables, all formulas as requested
- **DO**: Present content using these fields: top-level `text`, `result[n].markdown`, and `result[n].prunedResult`
- **DON'T**: Truncate with "..." unless content is excessively long (>10,000 chars)
- **DON'T**: Summarize or provide excerpts when user asks for full content
- **DON'T**: Say "Here's a preview" when user expects complete output

**Example - Correct**:
```
User: "Extract all the text from this document"
Agent: I've parsed the complete document. Here's all the extracted text:

[Display entire text field or concatenated regions in reading order]

Document Statistics:
- Total regions: 25
- Text blocks: 15
- Tables: 3
- Formulas: 2
Quality: Excellent (confidence: 0.92)
```

**Example - Incorrect**:
```
User: "Extract all the text"
Agent: "I found a document with multiple sections. Here's the beginning:
'Introduction...' (content truncated for brevity)"
```

### Understanding the JSON Response

The output JSON uses an envelope wrapping the raw API result:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "text": "Full markdown/HTML text extracted from all pages",
  "result": { ... },  // raw provider response
  "error": null
}
```

**Key fields**:
- `text` — extracted markdown text from all pages (use this for quick text display)
- `result` - raw provider response object
- `result[n].prunedResult` - structured parsing output for each page (layout/content/confidence and related metadata)
- `result[n].markdown` — full rendered page output in markdown/HTML

> Raw result location (default): the temp-file path printed by the script on stderr

### Usage Examples

**Example 1: Extract Full Document Text**
```bash
python scripts/vl_caller.py \
  --file-url "https://example.com/paper.pdf" \
  --pretty
```

Then use:
- Top-level `text` for quick full-text output
- `result[n].markdown` when page-level output is needed

**Example 2: Extract Structured Page Data**
```bash
python scripts/vl_caller.py \
  --file-path "./financial_report.pdf" \
  --pretty
```

Then use:
- `result[n].prunedResult` for structured parsing data (layout/content/confidence)
- `result[n].markdown` for rendered page content

**Example 3: Print JSON Without Saving**
```bash
python scripts/vl_caller.py \
  --file-url "URL" \
  --stdout \
  --pretty
```

Then return:
- Full `text` when user asks for full document content
- `result[n].prunedResult` and `result[n].markdown` when user needs complete structured page data

### First-Time Configuration

**When API is not configured**:

The error will show:
```
PADDLEOCR_DOC_PARSING_API_URL not configured. Get your API at: https://paddleocr.com
```

**Configuration workflow**:

1. **Show the exact error message** to the user (including the URL).

2. **Guide the user to configure securely**:
   - Recommend configuring through the host application's standard method (e.g., settings file, environment variable UI) rather than pasting credentials in chat.
   - List the required environment variables:
     ```
     - PADDLEOCR_DOC_PARSING_API_URL
     - PADDLEOCR_ACCESS_TOKEN
     - Optional: PADDLEOCR_DOC_PARSING_TIMEOUT
     ```

3. **If the user provides credentials in chat anyway** (accept any reasonable format):
   - `PADDLEOCR_DOC_PARSING_API_URL=https://xxx.paddleocr.com/layout-parsing, PADDLEOCR_ACCESS_TOKEN=abc123...`
   - `Here's my API: https://xxx and token: abc123`
   - Copy-pasted code format
   - Any other reasonable format
   - **Security note**: Warn the user that credentials shared in chat may be stored in conversation history. Recommend setting them through the host application's configuration instead when possible.

4. **Parse and validate the values**:
   - Extract `PADDLEOCR_DOC_PARSING_API_URL` (look for URLs with `paddleocr.com` or similar)
   - Confirm `PADDLEOCR_DOC_PARSING_API_URL` is a full endpoint ending with `/layout-parsing`
   - Extract `PADDLEOCR_ACCESS_TOKEN` (long alphanumeric string, usually 40+ chars)
   - Tell the user exactly which environment variables to set

5. **Ask the user to confirm the environment is configured**:
   - Wait for the user to confirm these values have been set in their host application, runtime environment, or appropriate config file
   - For security reasons, do not run `configure.py` or create a local `.env` file by default if the skill is installed under a host application directory (for example, `~/.claude/skills`)

6. **Retry only after confirmation**:
   - Once the user confirms the environment variables are available, retry the original parsing task

**IMPORTANT**: The error message format is STRICT and must be shown exactly as provided by the script. Do not modify or paraphrase it.

### Handling Large Files

There is no file size limit for the API. For PDFs, the maximum is 100 pages per request.

**Tips for large files**:

#### Use URL for Large Local Files (Recommended)
For very large local files, prefer `--file-url` over `--file-path` to avoid base64 encoding overhead:
```bash
python scripts/vl_caller.py --file-url "https://your-server.com/large_file.pdf"
```

#### Process Specific Pages (PDF Only)
If you only need certain pages from a large PDF, extract them first:
```bash
# Extract pages 1-5
python scripts/split_pdf.py large.pdf pages_1_5.pdf --pages "1-5"

# Mixed ranges are supported
python scripts/split_pdf.py large.pdf selected_pages.pdf --pages "1-5,8,10-12"

# Then process the smaller file
python scripts/vl_caller.py --file-path "pages_1_5.pdf"
```

### Error Handling

**Authentication failed (403)**:
```
error: Authentication failed
```
→ Token is invalid, reconfigure with correct credentials

**API quota exceeded (429)**:
```
error: API quota exceeded
```
→ Daily API quota exhausted, inform user to wait or upgrade

**Unsupported format**:
```
error: Unsupported file format
```
→ File format not supported, convert to PDF/PNG/JPG

## Important Notes

- **The script NEVER filters content** - It always returns complete data
- **The AI agent decides what to present** - Based on user's specific request
- **All data is always available** - Can be re-interpreted for different needs
- **No information is lost** - Complete document structure preserved

## Reference Documentation

- `references/output_schema.md` - Output format specification

> **Note**: Model version and capabilities are determined by your API endpoint (`PADDLEOCR_DOC_PARSING_API_URL`).

Load these reference documents into context when:
- Debugging complex parsing issues
- Need to understand output format
- Working with provider API details

## Testing the Skill

To verify the skill is working properly:
```bash
python scripts/smoke_test.py
```

This tests configuration and optionally API connectivity.
