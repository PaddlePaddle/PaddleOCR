# E-book: *Dive Into OCR*

"Dive Into OCR" is a textbook that combines OCR theory and practice, written by the PaddleOCR community. The main features are as follows:

- OCR full-stack technology covering text detection, recognition and document analysis
- Closely integrate theory and practice, cross the code implementation gap, and supporting instructional videos
- Jupyter Notebook textbook, flexibly modifying code for instant results

- The first part is the preliminary knowledge of the book, including the knowledge index and resource links needed in the process of positioning and using the book content of the book

- The second part is chapters 4-8 of the book, which introduce the concepts, applications, and industry practices related to the detection and identification capabilities of the OCR engine. In the "Introduction to OCR Technology", the application scenarios and challenges of OCR, the basic concepts of technology, and the pain points in industrial applications are comprehensively explained. Then, in the two chapters of "Text Detection" and "Text Recognition", the two basic tasks of OCR are introduced. In each chapter, an algorithm is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the code and practical exercises. Chapters 6 and 7 are a detailed introduction to the PP-OCR series model, PP-OCR is a set of OCR systems for industrial applications, on the basis of the basic detection and identification model, after a series of optimization strategies to achieve the general field of industrial SOTA model, while opening up a variety of predictive deployment solutions, enabling enterprises to quickly land OCR applications.

- The third part is chapter 9-12 of the book, which introduces applications other than the two-stage OCR engine, including data synthesis, preprocessing algorithm, and end-to-end model, focusing on OCR's layout analysis, table recognition, visual document question and answer capabilities in the document scene, and also through the combination of algorithm and code, so that readers can deeply understand and apply.
