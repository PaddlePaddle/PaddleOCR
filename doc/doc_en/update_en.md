# RECENT UPDATES
- 2020.12.15 update Data synthesis tool, i.e., [Style-Text](../../StyleText/README.md)，easy to synthesize a large number of images which are similar to the target scene image.
- 2020.11.25 Update a new data annotation tool, i.e., [PPOCRLabel](../../PPOCRLabel/README.md), which is helpful to improve the labeling efficiency. Moreover, the labeling results can be used in training of the PP-OCR system directly.
