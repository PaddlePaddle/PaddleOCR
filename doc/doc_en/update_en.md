Find tutorial [here](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/blob/release/2.1/doc/doc_en/pgnet_en.md)；release multi language recognition [models](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/blob/release/2.1/doc/doc_en/multi_languages_en.md), support more than 80 languages recognition; especically, the performance of [English recognition model](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/blob/release/2.1/doc/doc_en/models_list_en.md#English) is Optimized.

- 2021.1.21 update more than 25+ multilingual recognition models [models list](./models_list_en.md), including：English, Chinese, German, French, Japanese，Spanish，Portuguese Russia Arabic and so on.  Models for more languages will continue to be updated [Develop Plan](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/issues/1048).
- 2020.12.15 update Data synthesis tool, i.e., [Style-Text](../../StyleText/README.md)，easy to synthesize a large number of images which are similar to the target scene image.
- 2020.11.25 Update a new data annotation tool, i.e., [PPOCRLabel](../../PPOCRLabel/README.md), which is helpful to improve the labeling efficiency. Moreover, the labeling results can be used in training of the PP-OCR system directly.
