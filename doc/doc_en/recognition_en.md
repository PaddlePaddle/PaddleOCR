## 1. Data Preparation

### 1.1 DataSet Preparation

To prepare datasets, refer to [ocr_datasets](./dataset/ocr_datasets.md) .

If you want to reproduce the paper SAR, you need to download extra dataset [SynthAdd](https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=uV0LtoNmcxbO-0YA7Ch4dg), extraction code: 627x. Besides, icdar2013, icdar2015, cocotext, IIIT5k datasets are also used to train. For specific details, please refer to the paper SAR.

<a name="Dictionary"></a>
### 1.2 Dictionary

Finally, a dictionary ({word_dict_name}.txt) needs to be provided so that when the model is trained, all the characters that appear can be mapped to the dictionary index.

Therefore, the dictionary needs to contain all the characters that you want to be recognized correctly. {word_dict_name}.txt needs to be written in the following format and saved in the `utf-8` encoding format:

```
l
d
a
d
r
n
```

In `word_dict.txt`, there is a single word in each line, which maps characters and numeric indexes together, e.g "and" will be mapped to [2 5 1]

PaddleOCR has built-in dictionaries, which can be used on demand.

`ppocr/utils/ppocr_keys_v1.txt` is a Chinese dictionary with 6623 characters.

`ppocr/utils/ic15_dict.txt` is an English dictionary with 63 characters

`ppocr/utils/dict/french_dict.txt` is a French dictionary with 118 characters

`ppocr/utils/dict/japan_dict.txt` is a Japanese dictionary with 4399 characters

`ppocr/utils/dict/korean_dict.txt` is a Korean dictionary with 3636 characters

`ppocr/utils/dict/german_dict.txt` is a German dictionary with 131 characters

`ppocr/utils/en_dict.txt` is a English dictionary with 96 characters


The current multi-language model is still in the demo stage and will continue to optimize the model and add languages. **You are very welcome to provide us with dictionaries and fonts in other languages**,
If you like, you can submit the dictionary file to [dict](../../ppocr/utils/dict) and we will thank you in the Repo.


To customize the dict file, please modify the `character_dict_path` field in `configs/rec/rec_icdar15_train.yml` .

- Custom dictionary

If you need to customize dic file, please add character_dict_path field in configs/rec/rec_icdar15_train.yml to point to your dictionary path. And set character_type to ch.

### 1.4 Add Space Category

If you want to support the recognition of the `space` category, please set the `use_space_char` field in the yml file to `True`.

<a name="TRAINING"></a>
## 2.Training

<a name="Data_Augmentation"></a>
### 2.1 Data Augmentation

PaddleOCR provides a variety of data augmentation methods. All the augmentation methods are enabled by default.

The default perturbation methods are: cvtColor, blur, jitter, Gasuss noise, random crop, perspective, color reverse, TIA augmentation.

Each disturbance method is selected with a 40% probability during the training process. For specific code implementation, please refer to: [rec_img_aug.py](../../ppocr/data/imaug/rec_img_aug.py)

<a name="Training"></a>
### 2.2 General Training

PaddleOCR provides training scripts, evaluation scripts, and prediction scripts. In this section, the CRNN recognition model will be used as an example:

First download the pretrain model, you can download the trained model to finetune on the icdar2015 data:

```
cd PaddleOCR/
# Download the pre-trained model of MobileNetV3
wget -P ./pretrain_models/ https://paddleocr.bj.bcebos.com/dygraph_v2.0/en/rec_mv3_none_bilstm_ctc_v2.0_train.tar
# Decompress model parameters
cd pretrain_models
tar -xf rec_mv3_none_bilstm_ctc_v2.0_train.tar && rm -rf rec_mv3_none_bilstm_ctc_v2.0_train.tar
```

Start training:

```
# GPU training Support single card and multi-card training
# Training icdar15 English data and The training log will be automatically saved as train.log under "{save_model_dir}"

#specify the single card training(Long training time, not recommended)
python3 tools/train.py -c configs/rec/rec_icdar15_train.yml
#specify the card number through --gpus
python3 -m paddle.distributed.launch --gpus '0,1,2,3'  tools/train.py -c configs/rec/rec_icdar15_train.yml
```


PaddleOCR supports alternating training and evaluation. You can modify `eval_batch_step` in `configs/rec/rec_icdar15_train.yml` to set the evaluation frequency. By default, it is evaluated every 500 iter and the best acc model is saved under `output/rec_CRNN/best_accuracy` during the evaluation process.

If the evaluation set is large, the test will be time-consuming. It is recommended to reduce the number of evaluations, or evaluate after training.

* Tip: You can use the `-c` parameter to select multiple model configurations under the `configs/rec/` path for training. The recognition algorithms supported by PaddleOCR are:

For more supported languages, please refer to : [Multi-language model](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/blob/release/2.1/doc/doc_en/multi_languages_en.md#4-support-languages-and-abbreviations)


If you want to finetune on the basis of the existing model effect, please refer to the following instructions to modify the configuration file:

Take `rec_french_lite_train` as an example:

```
Global:
  ...
  # Add a custom dictionary, such as modify the dictionary, please point the path to the new dictionary
  character_dict_path: ./ppocr/utils/dict/french_dict.txt
  ...
  # Whether to recognize spaces
  use_space_char: True

...

### 2.4 Training with Knowledge Distillation

Knowledge distillation is supported in PaddleOCR for text recognition training process. For more details, please refer to [doc](./knowledge_distillation_en.md).

<a name="EVALUATION"></a>

## 3. Evalution

The evaluation dataset can be set by modifying the `Eval.dataset.label_file_list` field in the `configs/rec/rec_icdar15_train.yml` file.

```
# GPU evaluation, Global.checkpoints is the weight to be tested
python3 -m paddle.distributed.launch --gpus '0' tools/eval.py -c configs/rec/rec_icdar15_train.yml -o Global.checkpoints={path/to/weights}/best_accuracy
```

<a name="PREDICTION"></a>
## 4. Prediction


Using the model trained by paddleocr, you can quickly get prediction through the following script.

The default prediction picture is stored in `infer_img`, and the trained weight is specified via `-o Global.checkpoints`:


According to the `save_model_dir` and `save_epoch_step` fields set in the configuration file, the following parameters will be saved:

```
output/rec/
├── best_accuracy.pdopt  
├── best_accuracy.pdparams  
├── best_accuracy.states  
├── config.yml  
├── iter_epoch_3.pdopt  
├── iter_epoch_3.pdparams  
├── iter_epoch_3.states  
├── latest.pdopt  
├── latest.pdparams  
├── latest.states  
└── train.log
```

Among them, best_accuracy.* is the best model on the evaluation set; iter_epoch_x.* is the model saved at intervals of `save_epoch_step`; latest.* is the model of the last epoch.

```
# Predict English results
python3 tools/infer_rec.py -c configs/rec/ch_ppocr_v2.0/rec_chinese_lite_train_v2.0.yml -o Global.pretrained_model={path/to/weights}/best_accuracy Global.load_static_weights=false Global.infer_img=doc/imgs_words/en/word_1.jpg
```


Input image:

![](../imgs_words/en/word_1.png)

Get the prediction result of the input image:

```
infer_img: doc/imgs_words/en/word_1.png
        result: ('joint', 0.9998967)
```

The configuration file used for prediction must be consistent with the training. For example, you completed the training of the Chinese model with `python3 tools/train.py -c configs/rec/ch_ppocr_v2.0/rec_chinese_lite_train_v2.0.yml`, you can use the following command to predict the Chinese model:

```
# Predict Chinese results
python3 tools/infer_rec.py -c configs/rec/ch_ppocr_v2.0/rec_chinese_lite_train_v2.0.yml -o Global.pretrained_model={path/to/weights}/best_accuracy Global.load_static_weights=false Global.infer_img=doc/imgs_words/ch/word_1.jpg
```

Input image:

![](../imgs_words/ch/word_1.jpg)

Get the prediction result of the input image:

```
infer_img: doc/imgs_words/ch/word_1.jpg
        result: ('韩国小馆', 0.997218)
```

<a name="Inference"></a>

## 5. Convert to Inference Model

The recognition model is converted to the inference model in the same way as the detection, as follows:

```
# -c Set the training algorithm yml configuration file
# -o Set optional parameters
# Global.pretrained_model parameter Set the training model address to be converted without adding the file suffix .pdmodel, .pdopt or .pdparams.
# Global.save_inference_dir Set the address where the converted model will be saved.

python3 tools/export_model.py -c configs/rec/ch_ppocr_v2.0/rec_chinese_lite_train_v2.0.yml -o Global.pretrained_model=./ch_lite/ch_ppocr_mobile_v2.0_rec_train/best_accuracy  Global.save_inference_dir=./inference/rec_crnn/
```

If you have a model trained on your own dataset with a different dictionary file, please make sure that you modify the `character_dict_path` in the configuration file to your dictionary file path.

After the conversion is successful, there are three files in the model save directory:

```
inference/det_db/
    ├── inference.pdiparams         # The parameter file of recognition inference model
    ├── inference.pdiparams.info    # The parameter information of recognition inference model, which can be ignored
    └── inference.pdmodel           # The program file of recognition model
```

- Text recognition model Inference using custom characters dictionary

  If the text dictionary is modified during training, when using the inference model to predict, you need to specify the dictionary path used by `--rec_char_dict_path`

  ```
  python3 tools/infer/predict_rec.py --image_dir="./doc/imgs_words_en/word_336.png" --rec_model_dir="./your inference model" --rec_image_shape="3, 32, 100" --rec_char_dict_path="your text dict path"
  ```
